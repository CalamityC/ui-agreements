# UI - Getting started #
Get up-to-speed and set up with the projec.

## Pre - reading ##
The UI module is designed to work within the [FOLIO](https://github.com/folio-org) UX framework [stripes](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core).
The module itself is written javascipt using the [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/index.html) standard. Although the
majority comes from ES7 we do use some features that were released in ES8, e.g. async functions.

The project is transpiled and bundled using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
